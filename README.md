# Personal Website

This is a standalone project for your personal website, styled after the Rubin Chat dark mode.

## Setup

1. Navigate to this directory:
   ```bash
   cd personal-website
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Structure

- `src/App.jsx`: Main application component containing the layout and content.
- `src/index.css`: Styles matching the Rubin Chat dark mode (fonts, colors, background texture).
- `index.html`: Entry point with font imports.

## Customization

- Edit `src/App.jsx` to update your projects and blog posts.
- The styling uses CSS variables in `src/index.css` which you can tweak.
